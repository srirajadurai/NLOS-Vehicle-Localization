This project focuses on improving vehicle localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios within urban VANETs using metaheuristic algorithms like Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing. It aims to enhance message delivery reliability and reduce latency by accurately identifying node positions in complex urban environments.
